          "excerpt": "Our latest study on the giant impact origin of Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces has been published in Nature Geoscience, providing new insights into Earth's early bombardment history.",
          "content": "Deep inside Earth, scientists have long puzzled over two giant mysterious regions above the planet‚Äôs core known as ‚Äúlarge low shear-wave velocity provinces‚Äù (LLSVPs), along with smaller patches called ‚Äúultra-low velocity zones‚Äù (ULVZs). These regions look very different from the rest of the mantle in seismic images, but their origin has remained unclear. Our new research suggests they may have formed from an ancient ‚Äúbasal magma ocean‚Äù at the bottom of Earth‚Äôs mantle, which was gradually mixed with material exsolved from the core. This process, which we call a ‚Äúbasal exsolution contaminated magma ocean‚Äù (BECMO), prevented the buildup of unrealistic iron-rich layers and instead produced mantle structures that match what seismologists observe today. Computer models show that solidified BECMO material could explain both the vast LLSVPs and the smaller ULVZs. The BECMO also carries distinctive chemical signals‚Äîsuch as silicon, tungsten, and helium isotopes‚Äîthat are often detected in volcanic rocks at ocean islands like Hawaii and Iceland. This means the same process may connect Earth‚Äôs deepest mantle to the volcanic activity we see at the surface, offering a unified explanation for some of the planet‚Äôs most enduring geochemical and geophysical mysteries.",

            "Core exsolution suppresses the crystallization of ferropericlase, helping reconcile models of magma ocean solidification with seismic observations.",
            "Geodynamic modeling shows these processes can produce mantle structures consistent with the anomalies we see in the lowermost mantle.",
            "This deep reservoir carries isotopic signals (Si, W, He) from the core ‚Äî possibly explaining certain ocean island basalt sources.",
            "The framework has implications for other planets with long-lived basal magma oceans and core‚Äìmantle interactions."
